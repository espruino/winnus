## Not so simple

[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) is the enabler of native add-on modules for Node.js and has been extended to also encompass Windows.

The README.md contains information concerning the build environment and can be used for reference. However, it is [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) that allow for building.

Please take time to ensure your build environment is correct by following the link from Microsofts current page to find "Walkthrough: Compiling a Native C++ Program on the Command Line" and access the contents as this can possibly save time in the long run.
